OneCore is a common library used by OneBag3 and its related addons.

## Purpose

OneBag3 and its related addons have always been about sharing as much code as possible. This library was basically
embedded in previous versions of OneBag. I've decided to break it out into its own project to improve the structure of
OneBag's code and hopefully speed future development.

This library currently provides OneBag's:

* Frame Creation Code
* Layout management
* Base Configuration options
* Locale information
* Slot coloring routines
* Helper mixins for Slots, Bags, and Frames
* And more!(tm)
